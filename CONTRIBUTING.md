## Contributing to Erupt
This guide will walk you through how to contribute to Erupt. Please take a few minutes to read through it before submitting an issue or pull request.

### Code of Conduct
We have a Code of Conduct that we expect all contributors to follow. Please take the time to read it in full to understand what is and isn’t acceptable.

### Transparent Development
All of our work is done on GitHub. Both core team members and external contributors must go through the same review process for pull requests.

### Bugs
We use GitHub Issues to track bugs.  
Before reporting a bug, please make sure to search existing issues and read our FAQ.

### First Contribution
If you’re not sure how to submit a Pull Request on GitHub, you can read the following articles to learn:
- [How to Contribute to Open Source](https://opensource.guide/zh-hans/how-to-contribute/)
- [First Time Contributing to Open Source](https://github.com/firstcontributions/first-contributions/tree/main/docs/translations)

If you plan to work on an issue, please check the comments to make sure no one else is already handling it. If no one is currently working on it, you can leave a comment to let others know you’ll be taking it on, to avoid duplicate efforts.  

If someone previously said they would handle the issue but there’s been no activity for a week or two, you can take it over—just be sure to leave a comment to inform others.

### Contributing Code
The Erupt team reviews all Pull Requests. We will review and merge your code, or possibly ask you to make changes or explain why we can’t accept certain changes.
